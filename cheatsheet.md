## List Functions

**head** takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically its first element.

```
    ghci> head [5,4,3,2,1]  
    5   
```

**tail** takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a list's head.

```
    ghci> tail [5,4,3,2,1]  
    [4,3,2,1]  
```
**last** takes a list and returns its last element.

```
    ghci> last [5,4,3,2,1]  
    1
```

**init** takes a list and returns everything except its last element.

```
    ghci> init [5,4,3,2,1]  
    [5,4,3,2]  
```

**length** takes a list and returns its length, obviously.

```
    ghci> length [5,4,3,2,1]  
    5
```

**null** checks if a list is empty. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. Use this function instead of xs == [] (if you have a list called xs)

```
    ghci> null [1,2,3]  
    False  
    ghci> null []  
    True
```

**reverse** reverses a list.

```
    ghci> reverse [5,4,3,2,1]  
    [1,2,3,4,5] 
```

**take** takes number and a list. It extracts that many elements from the beginning of the list. Watch.

```
    ghci> take 3 [5,4,3,2,1]  
    [5,4,3]  
```

**drop** works in a similar way, only it drops the number of elements from the beginning of a list.

```
    ghci> drop 3 [8,4,2,1,5,6]  
    [1,5,6]  
```

**maximum** takes a list of stuff that can be put in some kind of order and returns the biggest element.

**minimum** returns the smallest.

```
    ghci> minimum [8,4,2,1,5,6]  
    1  
    ghci> maximum [1,9,2,3,4]  
    9
```

**sum** takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.

**product** takes a list of numbers and returns their product.

```
    ghci> sum [5,2,1,6,3,2,5,7]  
    31  
    ghci> product [6,2,1,2]  
    24  
    ghci> product [1,2,5,6,7,9,2,0]  
    0
```

**elem** takes a thing and a list of things and tells us if that thing is an element of the list. It's usually called as an infix function because it's easier to read that way.

```
    ghci> 4 `elem` [3,4,5,6]  
    True  
    ghci> 10 `elem` [3,4,5,6]  
    False  
```
